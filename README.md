# AI Generalist Playground

Hands-on experiments with AI tools for marketing automation, voice, and video.

## Current focus
- 🎙️ **ElevenLabs** — exploring voice cloning and expressive text-to-speech
- 🎥 **HeyGen** — testing video avatar creation workflows
- ⚡ **Make.com + Google Sheets** — building lightweight automations with APIs

## Why this repo exists
This is my personal sandbox to:
- Learn by building small, practical demos
- Document what works (and what doesn’t)
- Show recruiters and collaborators clear examples of applied AI in marketing contexts

## Roadmap
- [ ] Upload ElevenLabs script pack & first generated samples
- [ ] Document a HeyGen avatar test with notes/screenshots
- [ ] Add a simple Make.com → Google Sheets automation export
- [ ] Create a Jupyter notebook for “cost vs. quality” voice tests

## Notes for visitors
- This is not about polished production code.  
- It’s a **learning log** that grows over time.  
- If you’re a recruiter: this repo is meant to showcase curiosity, adaptability, and real-world application of AI tools.

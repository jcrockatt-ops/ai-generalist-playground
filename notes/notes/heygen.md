# HeyGen – Quick Notes

**Goal**
- Generate one short avatar clip (10–20s) from text

**Tiny checklist**

- [ ] Saved a screenshot of settings (for the repo later)

**What I’ll compare**
- Lip sync feel
- Eye movement
- Pacing / natural pauses

- “Welcome! This is a quick avatar demo so I can evaluate realism.”

**Observations**

# ElevenLabs – Quick Notes

**What I’m trying**
- Generate one clean line of speech from a stock voice
- Compare 2–3 style settings (stability/similarity)
- Save best result and note why it sounded better

**Tiny checklist**
- [ ] Created ElevenLabs account
- [ ] Found API key (will go into a .env later — not uploaded)
- [ ] Chose 1 test script (15–20 seconds)
- [ ] Logged what I liked/didn’t like

**Script ideas (pick one)**
- “Hi, this is Jason. I’m testing a short line for voice clarity, pacing, and tone.”
- “Welcome back! This is a quick demo to hear how the voice handles natural pauses.”

**Observations (fill as you go)**
- Run 1:  
- Run 2:  
- Best take & why:
